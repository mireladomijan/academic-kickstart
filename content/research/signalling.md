Dormancy is the time of temporary arrest of  an organism's growth and development due to unfavourable external conditions. Dr. Benedicte Wenden's group (at INRIA, Bordeaux) has been looking at how abscisic acid (ABA) and giberellin (GA) hormonal pathways control the bud dormancy of sweet cherries. In collaboration with them, we've constructed a model of ABA accumulation in several sweet cherry cultivars that sheds light on how the dormancy is affected BY ABA [(1)](/publication/aba-signalling/).
