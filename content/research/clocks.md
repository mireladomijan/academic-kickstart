The plant circadian clock is an endogenous time keeper that controls many physiological and developmental processes in plants. Since the clock has such a prominent role,  gaining  a better understanding of its mechanism and  its interaction with the environment is of great import.
Up to date, I've been interested in how light inputs shape the clock behaviour [(1)](/publication/Hy5/) and how they influence the clock's ability to sense temperature [(2)](http://msb.embopress.org/content/9/1/650.long);  how the clock entrains to but also buffers external light and temperature signals [(3)](http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/1/177) and  how the clock  helps control  plants' thermoresponsive growth [(4)](/publication/Phytochromes/), [(5)](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-98221401424-9).

Individual cells contain clocks, so  the most recent work integrates single-cell imaging and mathematical modelling  in order to study how these individual rhythms are co-ordinated [(6)](/publication/eLife/).
