# Biography

I am a biomathematician interested in applying quantitative methods in order to study a variety of biological systems. Some of my current interests are listed below. Prior to coming to Liverpool I held postdoctoral positions at Cambridge (in the Sainsbury Laboratory) and at Warwick (in the Centre for Systems Biology).
